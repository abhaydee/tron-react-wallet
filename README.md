## Inspiration
What inspired us to build Iamgroot is that as students we love to hangout with our friends even after the college gets over, talk with them and play. There wasn't any platform specifically for university related so, we came up with Iamgroot which depicts individual universities.

## What it does
Once you're on Iamgroot, You'll get an unique avatar in 3D which you can customise yourself. There's even a store in which you can shop hoodies or caps with Tron wallet and that merchandise will get shipped to you in real life too as well as the avatar which you'll enter into the game. Then, when you enter into the university you can leisurely roam around the campus, find the most happening things in and around campus. You can talk with your fellow friends if they are online and feel like talking in real life. Suppose there are events going on such as movie screening, you along with you friends can go over to billboard signs and watch with them. The best part about Iamgroot is that you can organise events as an individual and your friends can register, get tickets and attend it. One amazing feature of Iamgroot is that you don't need to download anything, everything runs on the browser.

## How we built it
We first took the university's 3D model using google earth and then rendered it from blender and then scaled it according to the plan. Next, we created an avatar to depict a specific individual and a merchandise store for the avatar to shop from using Tron wallet. Moving on, we used Three JS to make the 3D models functioning and doing the work, be it roaming around campus or watching something on a billboard. We took the coordinates from the avatar to find where exactly he is and then used those coordinates to talk with your friends which feels like real life.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the hardest challenges was integrating minting merchandise stores. We were not able to figure a way to make it happen, even though we used the same exact code on developer tools. Rendering the 3D university model was also a problem, as we had scraped the model from google earth and it broke a few times until we finally achieved it. The physics for the avatar was a major challenge as we had to ensure the walking rate, speed, turning left or right.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
University 3D model works well without any lag. The avatar physics works superb. 

## What we learned
We learnt a lot of new things working on the project, as the Tron blockchain was a new thing to catch up.
We got a clear understanding of the smart contracts on Tron in addition to the Tron IDE which was a life saver. This was our first ever project on 3D related games, and we learnt how to create functionalities when making certain events.

## What's next for Iamgroot
We are planning on putting billboards around the campus for groups to promote their events or the news around the campus in real time
